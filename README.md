# 🐸 Animal Customizer Game – HCI Exhibition Project

This project is a creative and educational browser-based game developed for the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** end-of-course exhibition. The game lets users interact directly with code to **customize animals** such as a frog, dog, cat, and more by manipulating their shapes, positions, and sizes.

## 🎮 About the Game

Unlike typical games with visible UI controls, this game is designed to encourage **hands-on coding** as interaction. Children and beginner coders can **edit the JavaScript code** to:

* Position animal features using `x` and `y` coordinates
* Resize parts like eyes, mouth, and head

Each animal (Frog, Dog, Cat, etc.) has its own HTML/JS page, where users can freely modify the drawing code and observe the changes in real time.

## 👨‍🏫 Educational Goals

* Introduce children and students to **basic programming concepts**
* Improve spatial reasoning with `x`, `y`, and size values
* Demonstrate **HCI principles** through direct manipulation and visual feedback
* Encourage experimentation and creativity through code

## ✨ Features

* 🐸 Pre-built animals: Frog, Dog, Cat, and more coming soon (e.g., Among Us character)
* ✍️ Customize animal parts like eyes, head, ears, and mouth via code
* 🚫 No visible UI controls – interaction is fully code-driven

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

1. Open the project in a browser.
2. Select an animal from the main interface.
3. Open the browser's **developer tools** or **text editor**.
4. Modify the variables for `x`, `y`, `size`, `color`, etc.
5. Watch the changes update live in the browser.

## 🌈 Example Edits

```js
// Move the left eye
let leftEyeX = 60;
let leftEyeY = 80;

// Make the mouth bigger
let mouthWidth = 40;
let mouthHeight = 20;
```

## 📸 Coming Soon

* Save your animal as an image (`Save as PNG`)
* Add more animal templates
* Create a gallery of user-generated animals

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

Created as part of the final HCI project. Special thanks to all classmates, instructors, and exhibition participants for their support and feedback.
